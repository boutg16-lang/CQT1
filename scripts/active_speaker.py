"""Stable active-speaker selection for multi-person video crops.

The face detector supplies per-face ``activity_score`` values that combine
mouth opening and optional motion compensation.  This module adds temporal
hysteresis so the crop does not jump between speakers on a single noisy frame.
It deliberately has no model or network dependency and can be unit-tested with
plain dictionaries.
